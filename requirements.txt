# For Arduino projects, dependencies are typically managed as libraries within the Arduino IDE.
# This file lists the required Arduino libraries for this project.

# Please install the following library using the Arduino Library Manager:
# 1. Search for "HX711" and install the version by Rob Tillaart.
#    Alternatively, you can find it here: https://github.com/RobTillaart/HX711

# Arduino IDE: >= 1.8.0 (Recommended)
# Specific Board support packages might be needed depending on the microcontroller used (e.g., ESP32, SAMD boards).

Note this file doesn't behave like a Python "requirements.txt" file, where you can download the necessary libraries by running a "pip install" command with this file. Alternatively, follow the instructions laid out in the README to ensure you meet the software requirements for this project.
